               <h2 class="topics"id="subHeadings">Why I Enjoy Birdwatching</h2>
               <p class="funParagraph"id="testP">I like the adventure that goes along with looking for new birds. It takes me to new places and is a good way to get outside. I keep a list of all the birds that I have positively identified, 
                  and I enjoy checking off new birds for my "life list." I find their different behaviors fascinating and I like learning more about them. One can think
                  of it as like a grown up version of Pok√©mon, trying to identify all the different birds. Seeing a new kind of bird is thrilling!

               <h2 class="topics"id="subHeadings">Backyard Birds</h2>
               <p class="funParagraph">I have seen quite a variety of birds in my yard. I do keep feeders up to attract the birds. Some birds that are common to my yard are the
                  Red-shouldered Hawk, Dark-eyed Junco, Northern Cardinal, American Goldfinch, Downy Woodpecker, American Robin, Carolina Wren, Eastern Bluebird, and Northern Mockingbird. 
                  Some of my favorite birds that I have seen in my yard are not around quite as often. These would be the Great Crested Flycatcher, Chipping Sparrow, 
                  White-throated Sparrow, Gray Catbird, Hairy Woodpecker, and Rose-breasted Grosbeak.

               <h2 class="topics"id="subHeadings">Indiana Dunes National Park</h2>
               <p>When I visited Indiana Dunes National Park, it was winter, which changes the types of birds one may see. I did not see many, but I 
                  was more than satisfied to find Sandhill Cranes and observe them.

               <h2 class="topics"id="subHeadings">Loess Bluffs National Wildlife Refuge</h2>
               <p>The best birding day I have ever had by far was at Loess Bluffs National Wildlife Refuge. Each season brings new birds, as previously
                  mentioned, so a return visit is in store. It was late Winter when I visited and documented 20 new birds on my life list.
